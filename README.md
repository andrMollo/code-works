# CodeWorks

An add-in for SolidWorks with a set of tools to automate your workflow.

CodeWorks uses the [xCAD.NET](https://xcad.xarial.com/) framework for the add-in registration and connection to SolidWorks. It also uses [SolidDNA](https://github.com/CAD-Booster/solidworks-api) as a wrapper around the core of SolidWorks API.

CodeWorks can help you in different areas:

* [Manage SolidWorks custom properties](/CodeWorksLibrary/Macros/Properties/README.md)
* [Export files](/CodeWorksLibrary/Macros/Export/README.md)
* [Manage SolidWorks drawings and sheets](/CodeWorksLibrary/Macros/Drawings/README.md)

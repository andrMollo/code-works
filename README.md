# CodeWorks

An add-in for SolidWorks with a set of tools to automate your workflow.

CodeWorks uses the [xCAD.NET](https://xcad.xarial.com/) framework for the add-in registration and connection to SolidWorks. It also uses [SolidDNA](https://github.com/CAD-Booster/solidworks-api) as a wrapper around the core of SolidWorks API.

CodeWorks can help you in different areas:

* [Manage SolidWorks custom properties](/CodeWorksLibrary/Macros/Properties/README.md)
* [Export files](/CodeWorksLibrary/Macros/Export/README.md)
* [Manage SolidWorks drawings formats](/CodeWorksLibrary/Macros/Drawings/README.md)

## Installation

At the moment CodeWorks comes without an installer. To use CodeWorks you will have to clone this repository and compile the solution on your PC. xCAD.NET will automatically register the add-in for you.
